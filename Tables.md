### HTML tables

HTML tables might be less commonly used than buttons, links, lists and everything else you've learned so far, but there are some cases where they're the *perfect* tool. Some of the more advanced features can get a little tricky to set up correctly but getting started with tables is pretty easy. You create a table with `<table></table>` tags and then put the elements for rows, columns, headers, or anything else that's possible inside those table elements.

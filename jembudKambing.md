# Introduction

Git is a crucial skill to have, whether you’re just a hobbyist or you aim to become a professional web developer. It’s the “save” button on steroids and allows for seamless collaboration. There really aren’t all that many commands for you to learn, but sometimes the real difficulty of Git comes from visualizing what’s happening.

In this lesson, we’ll help with the visualization by diving deeper than just the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands you’ve mostly been using. We’ll cover topics such as **Remotes**, **Pointers**, and **Changing Git History**. This will expand your understanding of what’s actually going on under the hood with Git.

It is very important to take a look at all of this before progressing any further with the curriculum. The project work is becoming more and more complex, so using a disciplined Git workflow is no longer optional. Hopefully, after going through this lesson, you’ll be much more comfortable changing your Git history and have a better understanding of Git as a whole.
